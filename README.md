# Runnable examples for architecture and conventions.

This repository is a collection of runnable example applications which should demonstrate the desired architecture, conventions and patterns used across the move web frontend.

They will be always kept up to date with the discussed changes, so that they represent the __future__ in contrast to the actual application, which might be in an intermediate state during migration.
